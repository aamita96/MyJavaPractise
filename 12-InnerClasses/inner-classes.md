# 📝 Exploring Inner Classes in Java

This covers the four types of inner classes in Java, explaining what they are, when to use them, and how they work with practical examples.

### 1. Member Inner Class 🚗

A member inner class is a class defined within another class, at the same level as its instance variables and methods.

*   **Key Idea**: It acts like a **member of the outer class** and is strongly associated with an *instance* of the outer class.
*   **Access**: It can directly access the outer class's fields and methods, even private ones.
*   **Instantiation**: You must create an instance of the outer class first before you can create an instance of the member inner class.
    *   **Syntax**: `OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();`.
*   **When to Use**: Use it when two classes are logically linked, and the inner class needs to be closely tied to an instance of the outer class.
    *   **Example**: A `Car` class can have an `Engine` inner class. Each `Engine` object is inherently linked to a specific `Car` object (like a "Tata Safari" car having its own specific engine). The video shows how without an inner class, you'd need to manually pass the `Car` instance to the `Engine`'s constructor to create this link.


### ✅ Example:

```java
public class Car {
    private String model = "Tata Safari";

    class Engine {
        void start() {
            System.out.println(model + " engine started!");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        Car.Engine engine = car.new Engine(); // Member inner class
        engine.start();
    }
}
```

### 2. Static Nested Class 💻

A static nested class is a class marked with the `static` keyword inside another class.

*   **Key Idea**: It is associated with the **outer class itself**, not with an instance of it. It's more like a regular class that has been grouped inside another for organizational purposes.
*   **Access**: It **cannot** directly access the non-static (instance) members of the outer class. It can only access static members.
*   **Instantiation**: You can create an instance of a static nested class without creating an instance of the outer class.
    *   **Syntax**: `OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();`.
*   **When to Use**: Use it when you want to group related classes together for better organization and memory management, but the inner class doesn't depend on an instance of the outer class.
    *   **Example**: A `Computer` class can contain a static nested `USB` class. A USB is related to a computer, but it's not tied to a *specific computer instance*. This grouping helps keep related code together without creating unnecessary object dependencies.

### ✅ Example:

```java
public class Computer {
    static class USB {
        void plugIn() {
            System.out.println("USB plugged into computer.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Computer.USB usb = new Computer.USB(); // Static nested class
        usb.plugIn();
    }
}
```

### 3. Anonymous Inner Class 🎭

An anonymous inner class is a class without a name, created for a one-time use.

*   **Key Idea**: It allows you to **declare and instantiate a class at the same time**, typically for implementing an interface or extending a class on the fly.
*   **Syntax**: It is defined within an expression using the `new` keyword, followed by the name of the interface or class it's implementing/extending, and then curly braces `{}` containing the method implementations.
*   **When to Use**: Use it when you need a "one-time use" object and creating a separate, named class for a simple implementation would be overkill.
    *   **Example**: A `ShoppingCard` needs a `Payment` object. Instead of creating a whole new `CreditCard` class that implements the `Payment` interface, you can create an anonymous inner class right where the `Payment` object is needed, providing the implementation for the `pay()` method on the spot.

### ✅ Example:

```java
interface Payment {
    void pay(double amount);
}

public class ShoppingCart {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment = new Payment() {
            @Override
            public void pay(double amount) {
                System.out.println("Paid ₹" + amount + " using anonymous inner class.");
            }
        };

        payment.pay(499.99);
    }
}
```

### 4. Local Inner Class 🏨

A local inner class is a class defined inside a method or a block of code.

*   **Key Idea**: Its scope is **limited to the method or block** in which it is defined. It cannot be accessed from outside that method.
*   **Access**: It can access the members of the outer class, as well as the local variables and parameters of the method it's in (as long as they are final or effectively final).
*   **When to Use**: Use it when you need a class only for a very specific task within a single method. This helps to encapsulate logic that is relevant only to that method.
    *   **Example**: A `Hotel` class has a `reserveRoom()` method. Inside this method, a local inner class called `ReservationValidator` is created to handle all the validation logic (checking guest name, room availability, etc.). This keeps the validation logic neatly bundled and hidden within the `reserveRoom` method, where it's solely needed.

### ✅ Example:

```java
public class Hotel {
    public void reserveRoom(String guestName) {
        int availableRooms = 3;

        class ReservationValidator {
            void validate() {
                if (guestName != null && !guestName.isEmpty() && availableRooms > 0) {
                    System.out.println("Reservation successful for " + guestName);
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Reservation failed.");
                }
            }
        }

        ReservationValidator validator = new ReservationValidator();
        validator.validate();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Hotel hotel = new Hotel();
        hotel.reserveRoom("John Doe");
    }
}
```
