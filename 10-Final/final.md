# ‚ú® Understanding the `final` Keyword in Java

The `final` keyword is a non-access modifier in Java that can be applied to variables, methods, and classes. Its primary purpose is to restrict the user from modification. Each use case has a distinct and powerful meaning.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `final` with Variables: Creating Constants üè∫

Applying the `final` keyword to a variable makes it a constant, meaning its value can only be assigned **once**.

*   **Purpose:** Once a `final` variable is initialized, its value cannot be changed. Any attempt to reassign it will result in a compiler error: "Cannot assign a value to a final variable".
*   **Example (Instance Variable):**
    *   In a `Car` class, a `speedLimit` can be made `final` to ensure it's not modified after being set.
    *   **Code:** `public final int speedLimit = 200;`.
    *   Modern IDEs recognize `final` variables and will not offer to generate a "setter" method for them, as their value is intended to be permanent.
*   **Example (Static Variable):**
    *   To create a universal constant like Pi, you can combine `public`, `static`, and `final`.
    *   **Code:** `public static final double PI = 3.14159;`.
    *   Using `final` here prevents anyone from accidentally changing the value of PI elsewhere in the program.
*   **Initialization Rules ‚è≥:**
    *   A `final` variable **must be initialized** before use, otherwise the compiler will report an error.
    *   Initialization can happen in one of three places:
        1.  **At declaration:** `final int speedLimit = 200;`.
        2.  **In a constructor:** This is useful for instance-specific `final` variables that get their value when an object is created.
        3.  **In a static block:** This is used for `static final` variables that need some logic to be initialized.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `final` with Methods: Preventing Overriding üö´

A `final` method **cannot be overridden** by any subclass.

*   **Purpose:** This restriction ensures that the behavior of a critical method remains consistent and cannot be altered by child classes.
*   **Example (Safety Feature):**
    *   A `Car` class might have a crucial safety method called `airbags()` that guarantees four airbags.
    *   **Code in `Car` class:** `public final void airbags() { /* logic for 4 airbags */ }`.
    *   If a subclass like `EVCar` attempts to override this method (e.g., to reduce the number of airbags for cost-cutting), the compiler will prevent it.
    *   The error message will state: "airbags() cannot override airbags()... overridden method is final". This enforces that core functionalities, like safety features, are non-negotiable.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `final` with Classes: Preventing Inheritance üõë

A `final` class **cannot be extended** (or inherited from) by any other class.

*   **Purpose:** This is used to create immutable classes or to prevent other developers from creating subclasses of a core class.
*   **Example (Brand Exclusivity):**
    *   A premium car brand might declare its `PremiumCar` class as `final` to prevent others from creating variations of its exclusive model.
    *   **Code:** `public final class PremiumCar { ... }`.
    *   When another class tries to `extend PremiumCar`, the compiler will throw an error: "Cannot inherit from final PremiumCar". This effectively seals the class, ensuring its implementation is the one and only version.

### ‚ùì Can a Constructor be `final`? ü§î

*   **Answer:** **No**, a constructor cannot be declared as `final`.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   The `final` modifier on methods is used to prevent **overriding**, a concept related to inheritance.
    *   Constructors are **not inherited** and therefore cannot be overridden. A subclass constructor can call a parent class constructor using `super()`, but this is not overriding.
    *   Since constructors don't participate in overriding, applying the `final` keyword to them is meaningless, and the compiler will report it as an error: "modifier 'final' not allowed here".
